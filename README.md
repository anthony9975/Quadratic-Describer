This project accepts a quadratic equation in standard form. It then preforms calculations and returns features of the graph such as which direction it opens, how many roots and what they are, the x and y intercepts and also the line of symetry.
This java project uses java math skills as well as well planned out logic to perform all the math needed to calculate the features of the graph.
This was a school assignment and worked as an introduction to java programming. It served as a way to practice java math skills and well as method creation and usage.
